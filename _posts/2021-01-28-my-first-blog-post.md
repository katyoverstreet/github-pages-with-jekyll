# Post #1 : First Week
This week has been a whirlwiind of information thrown at me. I honestly can't say that I remember all that much of it. I will most certainly be going back and watching all of those videos again. I try to plan out my days and it just doesn't work, because when I plan, I just can't take into account how fast I can go, and how many times I will get stuck. I feel like, I'm just not understanding. I don't have a great grasp of the most basic things, which is why when they are trying to explain a concept, I simply don't understand it, not because they aren't making sense, but because they are using terms and words that I don't know the meaning of, which makes it hard to understand what they are trying to explain. I often get stuck and have to take time to look up basic words and concepts. It's a little frustrating, but I know that when I have a firm grasp of the basics, everything will fall in place, and will start making sense. I just want to facepalm because I didn't use the time before this started to look up the basic terms.
